Without mathematics it would be impossible to realise that life is a math problem, it is the recipient of hate but it gives us hope that every person needs. We are fine to work on any problem so long as it generates discussion about all aspects of life, from the idea of a powerful creation, to the way the poetry of a math equation in order generates interesting mathematics along the way!
