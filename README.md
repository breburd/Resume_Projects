# Resume\_Projects

These showcase some of my skills. There are projects in C, Java, C++, and Python. Several of these examples are from my undergraduate degree in Computer Science, showcasing my abilities to solve simple problems. I have recently added some examples that incorporate written reports using assignments from my courses in my Master's in Artificial Intelligence. The reports include reasons for choices made (i.e. choosing an ML model because it leverages speed over accuracy and vice versa depending on the needs of the case study).
